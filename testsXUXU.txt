echo -nnnnn -n abc
should be handle

ls | | cat
syntax error should happen

echo one > f1 | echo two >> f1 | cat < f1 | grep two
f1 shoul have one in it and shouldnt in the final print the two // probably priorities

cd -
Not printing where it goes

cat | cat | cat | cat << eof | sleep 3 | cat << eof2
5 fd opens

cat << 'eof' and cat << "eof"
should not expand when eof is in quotes

cat << $USER
should not exit the eof with the value of $USER

cat << eof | cat | cat | grep two
>one 
>two
>eof
two
#4fd open

Env is not organized by the order it should be

Export not organized asciialphabetially

echo << e
$USER
"$USER"

leaks in the copy expansion
